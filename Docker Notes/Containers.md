### #Containers
- This is a standard unit of software(as called)
- Container contains a package of code and dependencies to run that code
- The same container always yields the exact same application and execution behavior!!!
- No matter where or whom it might be executed
- Support for these type of containers is built into modern operating systems


### Running a container

before running the container you need to build an image and you can fire up multiple containers based on the same image
These containers will have separate file systems and are different from each other both based on resources and application wise
Changes in one container wont have any effect on another container
