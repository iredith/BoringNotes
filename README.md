Just sharing my knowledge... Wanna contribute? Please do it. Anything and all knowledge is to share and learn.

 I am writing my notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app, so somefiles will be emtpy for now and also there is different syntax for file linking using obsidian, hence you will frequently see double square brackets in the files that simply means that there is link between this current file and the filename mentioned inside that double square brackets.


See Contributing.MD file for more info.
