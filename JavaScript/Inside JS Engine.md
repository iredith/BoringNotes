-> In the end its all about managing memory and managing execution steps
-> For this we have two important concepts 
	Heap
		Long term Memory
		All about memory allocation
		Stores data in your system and manages access to it
	Stack
		important for execution of our code
		Execution context
			manages your program flow  - function calls and communication
			Whenever a function returns a value or simply is done with all its steps, its removed from the stack, the JS engine does this for us
