There are multiple ways for a network of devices to be connected to each other in order to communicate with each other

Some of such topologies includes
1. Star Topology
	1. All the devices are connected a center service center which is responsible for sending packets from sender to receiver
		1. The central devices are generally called **Switch** or **Hubs** 
2. Bus topology
3. Ring topology


### #Switch
Switches are dedicated devices in a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking capable devices using ethernet

Switches have multiple ports for multiple devices to connect to internet at once.
This makes switches to keep note of the port and device pair in order to serve the internet response packets.

### #Router
Routers job is to connect networks and pass on the data between them.
It does this by using routing hence the name.

Routing involves creating a path between networks so this data can be successfully delivered.
