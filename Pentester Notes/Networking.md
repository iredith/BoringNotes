Q. In this Network of devices, how do we identify which devices that we are talking to?
Ans:

All devices configured are different with two properties within a network

1. [[IP Address]] -> devices in a network have unique IP address to all
2. [[MAC address]] -> Devices have a unique MAC address whether they are in a network or in another network
```
