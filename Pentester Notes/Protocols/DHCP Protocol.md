IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP server

---
DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

---
When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request #DHCP_Discover to see if any DHCP servers are on the network

The #DHCP_Server then replies back with an IP address the device could user - #DHCP_Offer

The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP address - #DHCP_Request

Then lastly, the #DHCP_Server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the [[IP Address]] - #DHCP_ACK

---

The communication process

#Client  => DHCP Discover => Requesting for DHCP Server

#DHCP_Server  => DHCP Offer => Sends a free IP address that is not in use in that network

#Client => DHCP Request => Requests that the client accepts the IP address and identifies itself with that IP address in that network

#DHCP_Server  => DHCP ACK => Assignes that IP address to #Client and stores the information in cache for future purpose.
