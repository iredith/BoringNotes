We have two identifiers: **MAC address** and **IP address**

The #ARP or _Address Resolution Protocol_ is the technology that is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network

---
Simply, the #ARP protocol allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network. 
Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices

Devices can use the ARP protocol to find the MAC address of a device for communication

## How does this Protocol Work??

Each device within a network has a ledger to store information on, which is called [[cache]] 

In the context of ARP protocol, this cache stores the identifiers of the other devices on the network which are [[IP Address]] and [[MAC Address]]

In order to map these two identifiers together, the ARP protocol sends two types of messages
1. ARP Request
2. ARP Reply
