#Subnetting is the term given to splitting up a [[Networking|Network]] into a smaller, miniature networks within itself

Whilst you know where to send information in real life to the correct department within organization, networks need to know as well.
Network Admin use subnetting to categorise and assign specific parts of a network to reflect this.

#Subnetting is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called as _Subnet Mask ( #Subent_Mask )_

Subnets use the IP address in 3 different ways:
	- Identify the network address
		- This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a networks existence
		- a device with IP: 192.168.1.100 will be on the network identified by 192.168.1.0
	- Identify the host address
		- IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet
			- A device will have the network address of 192.168.1.1
	- Identity the default gateway
		- a special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network.

Subnetting provides a range of benefits, including
	1. Efficiency
	2. Security
	3. Full control of the network

Subnet mask consists of 4bytes which is 32 bits
